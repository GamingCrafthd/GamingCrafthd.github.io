**Good morning, evening or day!**

To make it short: I don't really have anything to talk about here.
But I'm sure we'll find good topics eventually.
The only problem I have is, that I don't really know how to blog.
I'm a part of the Generation Big-Tech Web, so I kinda missed forums, blogs and the old Internet.

Now thinking of it: I surely find some interesting topics I could talk about some day,
including my C++ Game I'm working on, the stuff I do at the [TSNV e.V.](https://www.tsnv.de), [WebLNP](https://weblnp.gamingcraft.de),
the open-source Leaflet-based transit map viewer or even something completely different.

**But that's it from me for now, see you soon!**
