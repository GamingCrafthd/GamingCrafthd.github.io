**Greetings, fellow humans!**

Today I'm going to talk a bit about the new UtilityClient 3 Major Release.
For everyone, who doesn't know: UtilityClient is a custom client for the popular video game "Minecraft: Java Edition",
which gives you some QoL features including a In-Game Overlay with important informations about your character,
so-called "Macros", which run Commands or send text messages via key presses
and the option to mod the client even further with the Addon API.

For normal users, the 3.0 might not seem like a big update, maybe it seems even like a downgrade,
because some features, including performance improvements and custom capes got lost in the transition to the new backend.
But exactly that was also a very important move, because UtilityClient 3 is the first version to be FabricMC-based and
so completly legal, because the original Minecraft source-code doesn't need to be shipped with UtilityClient anymore.
Also some features of the unreleased 2.16, which would've been the last UtilityClient 2 version will be shipped with UtilityClient 3.

Some other changes include the addition of a Installer and a Updater for even easier maintaince/installation of UtilityClient,
which hopefully improve the Ease of Use for normal users, which might not be experienced with game modding.

Future plans for generation 3 also include an overhaul of the User-Interface, support for FabricMC mods and many other features.
Regarding features, we need your help. If you have any ideas, [please create an issue in the official UtilityClient repository](https://www.github.com/utility-client/utilityclient/issues).

Last but not least: If you're interested, be sure to check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Utility-Client/UtilityClient), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/UtilityClient) and [Discord guild](https://discord.com/invite/qZ4PZUn) of UtilityClient for updates,
sneak peeks and more.

That being said, I hope I could introduce some of you to one of my largest and longest-living project and it's next big step into the future.

**See you later, alligator.**<br>
